# School-information-and-tracking-system-for-parents

The project provides a website for a school that is keen to involve parents in the education process, by sending short messages on mobile and e-mail, so that the guardian remains aware of everything related to their educational student son, and through the services provided by the system, the guardian is able to track the attendance of his son at the level of classes He is able to review the examination schedules and home activities, in addition to the ability to communicate with teachers and view their observations that contribute to the educational and educational development of the student ...
 This site also provides a comprehensive definition of the school and the most important features and services it provides, in addition to displaying all school activities that can be one of its competitive advantages among the rest of the schools.
 And in order for me to make this site comprehensive, I included the site with the latest news of the Ministry of Education, with the aim of educating parents about everything related to the education of their children.
 
**Project justifications**:
- Some parents are distracted from continuously monitoring the educational and educational level of their children.
- The administration's lack of confidence in the guardian’s knowledge of all the details of his son’s educational behavior, unless he personally goes to the request.
- Parents need to know the details of their child's school day, track his attendance record, and find out reviews that contribute to the educational and educational development of the student.
- Parents' need to obtain examination schedules and home activities required of their student son.
- Parents need to know the latest education news.
- The school is the second home for the student, and for this the article must follow some direct communication with the matter, through short messages and emails
- Difficulty accessing parents required for quick messages.
 - The need to keep pace with technological development.
